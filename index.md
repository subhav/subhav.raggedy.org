# About Me

Hiya! I'm Subhav Ramachandran.

I'm into computer systems, and I push buttons on a keyboard professionally at Google.

I have a couple ideas for personal projects that I'd like to see through at some point. This would a good place to post updates if I ever get around to them.

In the meantime, get in touch via [email](mailto:subhav@raggedy.org) or find me on [Github](https://github.com/subhav).
